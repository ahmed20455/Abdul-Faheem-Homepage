# My First Web Project

This is my first web project where I created a simple website using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The website consists of four pages: Home, About, Hobbies, and Goals.

## Project Overview

The project is a basic website with the following pages:

- **Home**: The landing page of the website, providing a brief introduction and navigation links to other pages.
- **About**: A page that provides more information about me, including my background, education, and interests.
- **Hobbies**: A page where I share my hobbies and interests outside of work or school.
- **Goals**: A page where I outline my goals and aspirations for the future.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML**: Used to structure the content of each page and define the layout.
- **CSS**: Used to style the appearance of the website, including colors, fonts, and layout.
- **JavaScript**: Used to add interactivity and dynamic behavior to the website, such as navigation menus and form validation.

## Project Structure

The project directory is organized as follows:
project/
├── index.html # Main entry point of the website (Home page)
